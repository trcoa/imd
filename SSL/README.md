## How to enable SSL

This .htaccess file will force the web browser to use the HTTPS version of the webpage. Just copy the code in there and past it above the text in the .htaccess file on the server.


```


# php -- BEGIN cPanel-generated handler, do not edit
# Set the “ea-php72” package as the default “PHP” programming language.
<IfModule mime_module>
  AddHandler application/x-httpd-ea-php72 .php .php7 .phtml
</IfModule>
# php -- END cPanel-generated handler, do not edit


```
